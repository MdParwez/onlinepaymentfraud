# ONLINE-PAYMENT-FRAUD-DETECTION

### Overview

This project focuses on detecting online payment fraud using various machine learning algorithms. The objective is to identify fraudulent transactions to enhance the security of online payment systems.

### Machine Learning Algorithms Used

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Employed to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on feature analysis.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Used for classification by finding the majority class among the k-nearest transactions.
- **Random Forest**: Utilized for its ensemble learning method, leveraging multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Logistic Regression**: Applied for binary classification to estimate the probability of a transaction being fraudulent.

### Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Gathered a dataset containing transaction details.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the data to handle missing values and categorical features.
   - Performed feature scaling to standardize the dataset.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conducted EDA to understand the distribution of data.
   - Visualized patterns and correlations between different features.
   - Identified key indicators of fraudulent transactions.

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Trained each machine learning algorithm on the training data.
   - Evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Compared the performance of different algorithms to select the best model.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Integrated the best-performing model into a Streamlit application.
   - Created an interactive user interface for real-time fraud detection.
   - Deployed the application to provide a user-friendly platform for detecting fraudulent transactions.

### Streamlit Application

The final model was deployed using Streamlit, a powerful and easy-to-use framework for building data applications. The Streamlit app allows users to:

- Upload transaction data for analysis.
- View predictions on whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
- Access visualizations and insights derived from the data.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms in detecting online payment fraud. By leveraging multiple algorithms and deploying the solution on a Streamlit app, it provides a robust and user-friendly tool for enhancing the security of online payment systems.

### Future Work

- **Improving Model Accuracy**: Explore additional machine learning algorithms and techniques to further improve prediction accuracy.
- **Real-time Detection**: Implement real-time data processing and fraud detection capabilities.
- **Scalability**: Enhance the application to handle larger datasets and more complex transaction patterns.
